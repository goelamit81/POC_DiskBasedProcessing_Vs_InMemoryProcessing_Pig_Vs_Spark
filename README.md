# POC_DiskBasedProcessing_Vs_InMemoryProcessing_Pig_Vs_Spark

For this POC, you will be doing your analysis using the below-mentioned use cases:

 

lookup of a single row from the entire data set

Filtering multiple rows

Group by and then order by

 

The above three use cases will be implemented using Pig and Spark RDD. Which means you are expected to develop 3*2 i.e. 6 programs, execute each of them in your Amazon EC2 instance/Cloudera Quickstart VM and generate the output in an HDFS location. Let's say for the use case "lookup of a single row from the entire data set", you will develop and execute a Pig script and Spark code using RDDs. You have to ensure that, the output generated by both the methods are consistent.
